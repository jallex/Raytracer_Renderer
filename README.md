## Final Project - Raytracer with Animations, textures, lights
## https://youtu.be/PULZVn62l_4

Note: Because of time constraints, I didn't have enough time to finish rendering out an animation complete with textures and lights. Adding in lights in combination with triangle meshes drastically increased render times, so making that culminative animation is something I will finish rendering after this course
